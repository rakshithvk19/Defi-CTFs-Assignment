# Puppet V2

The developers of the [previous pool](../puppet/PuppetPool.sol) seem to have learned the lesson. And released a new version.

Now theyâ€™re using a Uniswap v2 exchange as a price oracle, along with the recommended utility libraries. Shouldn't that be enough?

You start with 20 ETH and 10000 DVT tokens in balance. The pool has a million DVT tokens in balance at risk!

Save all funds from the pool, depositing them into the designated recovery account.
